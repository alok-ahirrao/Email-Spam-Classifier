## Introduction
Spam detection is a crucial task in the field of natural language processing and cybersecurity. This project explores different machine learning algorithms to effectively identify and filter out spam messages from a given dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains labeled examples of spam and non-spam messages. It is preprocessed and split into training and testing sets for model training and evaluation.

## Algorithms
The following machine learning algorithms are implemented and evaluated for spam detection:
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KN)
- Naive Bayes (NB)
- Random Forest (RF)
- Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
- Extra Trees Classifier (ETC)
- Logistic Regression (LR)
- AdaBoost
- XGBoost (xgb)
- Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT)
- Bagging Classifier (BgC)
- Decision Tree (DT)

## Usage
To run the project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/alok-ahirrao/Email-Spam-Classifier.git
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the main script: `streamlit run app.py`

## Results
The performance of each algorithm is evaluated based on accuracy and precision metrics. Results are presented in tabular format and can be found in the `results.csv` file.
